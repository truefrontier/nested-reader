## Session 2026-09-11 — in-page find and filter focus

### Facts about the app
- Tauri 2 + React reader for a folder of Markdown notes. `pnpm dev` runs it in a browser with an in-memory sample folder; `pnpm tauri dev` runs the real app.
- Keyboard shortcuts live in two places: native menu accelerators in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` (⌘K, ⌘\, ⌘[ and so on) and a `keydown` listener in `src/App.tsx`. ⌘R was moved into the webview earlier so it works while typing in a box; ⌘F, ⌘G, ⌘⇧G and ⌘/ follow the same pattern, and their menu items carry the keys in their labels.
- Page text is wrapped in spans by `applyWraps` (`src/lib/wraps.ts`) using offsets over each block's `textContent`. Selections, change tints and now find highlights all go through it.
- The ask and refine boxes focus themselves 60 ms after mounting (`useAutoFocus` in `src/reader/Popovers.tsx`).

### What was built
- Find bar (`src/reader/FindBar.tsx`) stacked under the review strip at the top of the pane being read. Case-insensitive substring matching, "n of m" count, ‹ › arrows, close.
- ⌘F opens it (a fresh selection becomes the query). ⌘G / ⌘⇧G step. ↵ in the box selects the current match. Every step also selects, which opens the ask box on the match with its input focused; ⌘R switches to refine and that mode survives further steps.
- `/` outside any box, or ⌘/, shows the tree if hidden and focuses its Filter box. Esc there clears the filter, then leaves the box.
- Esc inside an ask, refine or follow-up box now closes only that box (it used to also close whatever was behind it).
- README shortcut table and `docs/architecture.md` updated.

### Assumptions
- Find targets the main pane, or the split pane only when it is fullscreen; the split pane is not searched otherwise.
- Match selection only happens in the main pane and never while viewing an old version, because selection popovers only exist there.
- Menu items without accelerators are the right call for shortcuts that must work while typing, matching the ⌘R precedent.

### Verification
- `tsc` and `pnpm build` pass. Two Playwright scripts against `pnpm dev` covered every shortcut, wrap-around, no-match state, popover placement and focus.
- `cargo check` could not run on this Linux box (no GTK dev libraries), so the Rust menu change is checked by reading only.

### Possible next steps
- Try it in the real Tauri build on macOS to confirm ⌘F, ⌘G and ⌘/ reach the webview with the native menu in place.
- Carry the typed question across ⌘G steps instead of resetting it with each new selection, if that turns out to be wanted.
- Enter in the Filter box could open the first visible page.
