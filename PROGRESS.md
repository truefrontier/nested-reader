## Session: fade the loading skeleton before streamed text (2026-09-11)

### Leading assumptions
- "Loading animation" means the skeleton bars a new page shows while the model writes it (`src/reader/Page.tsx`, `.skeleton` in `src/styles/app.css`).
- The bars had no motion of their own, so they now pulse gently; the pulse is off under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- A page opened after streaming has already started shows its text straight away, with no skeleton and no fade.
- The skeleton that shows while a page file is still being read (body undefined) is a different wait and is unchanged.

### World facts
- Page generation streams through `generatePage` in `src/state/store.ts`; the page body starts as a heading-only stub and grows with each delta.
- The browser build uses the mock platform, which streams a fake answer after about 350 ms. It needs a model chosen in settings (`ml:settings` in localStorage), or it errors with "Choose a model".
- New Page opens beside the current page by default, in a split pane.
- Deciding the fade in an effect unmounted the skeleton for one frame, so the CSS transition never ran. Deriving the fade during render keeps the element mounted and the transition works.

### Timeline
1. Read the page, store, and CSS to find where the skeleton and streaming live.
2. Changed `Page.tsx`: the skeleton shows only while the page is heading-only; on the first streamed text it fades over 260 ms while the page keeps showing just the heading; then the streamed body appears and the skeleton is gone for the rest of the stream.
3. Changed `app.css`: skeleton opacity transition, `.fading` state, gentle pulse on the bars, reduced-motion opt-out.
4. Verified in headless Chromium with Playwright: per-frame opacity goes 1 to 0 over ~260 ms with only the heading visible, and text blocks appear only after the skeleton is removed.
5. Typecheck passes. Committed and pushed to `claude/vibrant-sagan-54yeny`.

### Possible next steps
- Add a streaming caret to the last block while text streams (the `.block.streaming` class exists but has no styling).
- Apply the same fade to the file-read skeleton if that wait ever feels abrupt.
